[AGENT]: Can you please provide your date of birth?

[AGENT]: Let me confirm, your full name is Alex Rivera and your date of birth is May 5th, 1988. Is that correct? If so, could you please spell your first and last name for me?

[PATIENT]: Yes, that’s correct. My first name is spelled A-L-E-X, and my last name is R-I-V-E-R-A.

[AGENT]: Let me confirm, I have your phone number as 5550890 and your date of birth as May 5, 1988. Is that correct?

[AGENT]: I can't pull up your information right now, but I'll make sure our clinic support team follows up with you about canceling your appointment. Please hold while I document this for our team.

[PATIENT]: Oh, okay. Actually, I’ve changed my mind. Instead of canceling completely, could I reschedule it for a different time? Maybe the following Monday if there’s availability.

[AGENT]: Got it, Alex. I'll update your request to reschedule your appointment for the following Monday instead of canceling. Please hold while I document this for our team.
